The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand how different devices communicate with each other on a network. The model is divided into seven layers, each of which performs a specific function.

The first layer, the Physical layer, is responsible for the actual physical transmission of data over the network medium. It deals with the hardware aspects of network communication, such as the cables, connectors, and network interface cards.

The second layer, the Data Link layer, is responsible for error-free communication between two adjacent devices on the same network. It handles issues such as flow control and error detection and correction.

The third layer, the Network layer, is responsible for routing data across different networks. It decides the optimal path for data to travel from source to destination.

The fourth layer, the Transport layer, is responsible for ensuring reliable data transfer between applications. It provides end-to-end error recovery and flow control mechanisms.

The fifth layer, the Session layer, is responsible for setting up, managing, and terminating sessions between applications. It handles issues such as synchronization and checkpointing.

The sixth layer, the Presentation layer, is responsible for ensuring that data is presented in a format that can be understood by the application. It handles tasks such as data compression, encryption, and decryption.

The seventh layer, the Application layer, is responsible for providing services to the end-user. It includes applications such as email, web browsers, and file transfer protocols
